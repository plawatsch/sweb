/**
 * @class Mutex
 *This is intended to be your standard-from-the-shelf Lock
 *However, since we cannot turn off interrupts and allocate Memory
 *at the same time, we have to use some other means:

// In Sweb we face the following Problems in designing a Lock
// - we want to assure mutual exclusion
// - threads put to sleep need to be remembered -> put on a list -> means allocating memory
// - we can't switch of Interrupts while allocating memory
// - we need to lock the list which is used by the lock
//
// To lock the sleepers_ list, we use an even simpler Mutex called SpinLock
// SpinLock doesn't acquire memory but instead threads waiting on the spinlock
// just loop until the lock is free. Unfortunately there is no way around this,
// until threads can be put to sleep properly.
//
// Another Problem we face are RaceConditions between acquire and release.
// To avoid, that release() might take a thread from the list, before acquire() has
// put one there, we need to acquire the spinlock before actually checking the
// Mutex-Lock itself.
// Thus we can assure, that we are on the list, before release is run, but not that
// we are actually asleep, before release tries to wake us. (in which case, we would never be woken)
// Therefore we can release the SpinLock only after we have gone to sleep. (after a fashion,
// since doing anything after having gone to sleep, is of course Impossible)
// the Scheduler Method sleepAndRelease() tries to accomplish this trick for us.
